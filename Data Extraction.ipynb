       "'International Financial Reporting Standard 15$$$Revenue from Contracts with Customers$$$Objective$$$The objective of this Standard is to establish the principles that an entity$$$shall apply to report useful information to users of financial  statements$$$about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue  and cash$$$flows  arising from a contract  with a customer .$$$Meeting the objective$$$To meet the objective in paragraph 1, the core principle of this Standard is$$$that an entity shall recognise revenue  to depict the transfer of promised goods$$$or services to customers  in an amount that reflects the consideration to which$$$the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.$$$An entity shall consider the terms of the contract  and all relevant facts and$$$circumstances when applying this Standard. An entity shall apply this$$$Standard, including the use of any practical expedients, consistently to$$$contracts with similar characteristics and in similar circumstances.$$$This Standard specifies the accounting for an individual contract  with$$$a customer . However, as a practical expedient, an entity may apply this$$$Standard to a portfolio of contracts (or performance obligations ) with similar$$$characteristics if the entity reasonably expects that the effects on the financial$$$statements of applying this Standard to the portfolio would not differ$$$materially from applying this Standard to the individual contracts (or$$$performance obligations) within that portfolio. When accounting for a$$$portfolio, an entity shall use estimates and assumptions that reflect the size$$$and composition of the portfolio.$$$Scope$$$An entity shall apply this Standard to all contracts with customers, except the$$$following:$$$(a) lease contracts within the scope of IFRS 16 Leases ;$$$(b) contracts within the scope of IFRS 17  Insurance Contracts . However, an$$$entity may choose to apply this Standard to insurance contracts that$$$have as their primary purpose the provision of services for a fixed fee$$$in accordance with paragraph 8 of IFRS 17;$$$(c) financial instruments and other contractual rights or obligations$$$within the scope of IFRS 9  Financial Instruments , IFRS 10  Consolidated$$$Financial Statements , IFRS 11  Joint Arrangements , IAS 27  Separate Financial$$$Statements  and IAS 28  Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures ; and$$$(d) non-monetary exchanges between entities in the same line of business$$$to facilitate sales to customers or potential customers. For example,$$$this Standard would not apply to a contract between two oil companies$$$that agree to an exchange of oil to fulfil demand from their customers$$$in different specified locations on a timely basis.$$$An entity shall apply this Standard to a contract (other than a contract  listed$$$in paragraph 5) only if the counterparty to the contract is a customer . A$$$customer is a party that has contracted with an entity to obtain goods or$$$services that are an output of the entity’s ordinary activities in exchange for$$$consideration. A counterparty to the contract would not be a customer if, for$$$example, the counterparty has contracted with the entity to participate in an$$$activity or process in which the parties to the contract share in the risks and$$$benefits that result from the activity or process (such as developing an asset in$$$a collaboration arrangement) rather than to obtain the output of the entity’s$$$ordinary activities.$$$A contract  with a customer  may be partially within the scope of this Standard$$$and partially within the scope of other Standards listed in paragraph 5.$$$(a) If the other Standards specify how to separate and/or initially measure$$$one or more parts of the contract, then an entity shall first apply the$$$separation and/or measurement requirements in those Standards. An$$$entity shall exclude from the transaction price  the amount of the part$$$(or parts) of the contract that are initially measured in accordance with$$$other Standards and shall apply paragraphs 73 –86 to allocate the$$$amount of the transaction price that remains (if any) to$$$each performance obligation within the scope of this Standard and to$$$any other parts of the contract identified by paragraph 7(b).$$$(b) If the other Standards do not specify how to separate and/or initially$$$measure one or more parts of the contract, then the entity shall apply$$$this Standard to separate and/or initially measure the part (or parts) of$$$the contract.$$$This Standard specifies the accounting for the incremental costs of obtaining a$$$contract  with a customer  and for the costs incurred to fulfil a contract with a$$$customer if those costs are not within the scope of another Standard (see$$$paragraphs 91 –104 ). An entity shall apply those paragraphs only to the costs$$$incurred that relate to a contract with a customer (or part of that contract)$$$that is within the scope of this Standard.$$$Recognition$$$Identifying the contract$$$An entity shall account for a contract  with a customer  that is within the$$$scope of this Standard only when all of the following criteria are met:$$$(a) the parties to the contract have approved the contract (in writing,$$$orally or in accordance with other customary business practices)$$$and are committed to perform their respective obligations;$$$(b) the entity can identify each party’s rights regarding the goods or$$$services to be transferred;$$$(c) the entity can identify the payment terms for the goods or services$$$to be transferred;$$$(d) the contract has commercial substance (ie the risk, timing or$$$amount of the entity’s future cash flows  is expected to change as a$$$result of the contract); and$$$(e) it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which$$$it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be$$$transferred to the customer. In evaluating whether collectability of$$$an amount of consideration is probable, an entity shall consider$$$only the customer’s ability and intention to pay that amount of$$$consideration when it is due. The amount of consideration to which$$$the entity will be entitled may be less than the price stated in the$$$contract if the consideration is variable because the entity may offer$$$the customer a price concession (see paragraph 52).$$$A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that creates$$$enforceable rights and obligations. Enforceability of the rights and obligations$$$in a contract is a matter of law. Contracts can be written, oral or implied by an$$$entity’s customary business practices. The practices and processes for$$$establishing contracts with customers vary across legal jurisdictions,$$$industries and entities. In addition, they may vary within an entity (for$$$example, they may depend on the class of customer or the nature of the$$$promised goods or services). An entity shall consider those practices and$$$processes in determining whether and when an agreement with a customer$$$creates enforceable rights and obligations.$$$Some contracts with customers  may have no fixed duration and can be$$$terminated or modified by either party at any time. Other contracts may$$$automatically renew on a periodic basis that is specified in the contract . An$$$entity shall apply this Standard to the duration of the contract (ie the$$$contractual period) in which the parties to the contract have present$$$enforceable rights and obligations.$$$For the purpose of applying this Standard, a contract  does not exist if each$$$party to the contract has the unilateral enforceable right to terminate a$$$wholly unperformed contract without compensating the other party (or$$$parties). A contract is wholly unperformed if both of the following criteria are$$$met:$$$(a) the entity has not yet transferred any promised goods or services to the$$$customer; and$$$(b) the entity has not yet received, and is not yet entitled to receive, any$$$consideration in exchange for promised goods or services.$$$If a contract  with a customer  meets the criteria in paragraph 9 at contract$$$inception, an entity shall not reassess those criteria unless there is an$$$indication of a significant change in facts and circumstances. For example, if a$$$customer’s ability to pay the consideration deteriorates significantly, an entity$$$would reassess whether it is probable that the entity will collect the$$$consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for the$$$remaining goods or services that will be transferred to the customer.$$$If a contract  with a customer  does not meet the criteria in paragraph 9, an$$$entity shall continue to assess the contract to determine whether the criteria$$$in paragraph 9 are subsequently met.$$$When a contract  with a customer  does not meet the criteria$$$in paragraph 9 and an entity receives consideration from the customer, the$$$entity shall recognise the consideration received as revenue  only when either$$$of the following events has occurred:$$$(a) the entity has no remaining obligations to transfer goods or services to$$$the customer and all, or substantially all, of the consideration$$$promised by the customer has been received by the entity and is non-$$$refundable; or$$$(b) the contract has been terminated and the consideration received from$$$the customer is non-refundable.$$$An entity shall recognise the consideration received from a customer  as a$$$liability until one of the events in paragraph 15 occurs or until the criteria in$$$paragraph 9 are subsequently met (see paragraph 14). Depending on the facts$$$and circumstances relating to the contract , the liability recognised represents$$$the entity’s obligation to either transfer goods or services in the future or$$$refund the consideration received. In either case, the liability shall be$$$measured at the amount of consideration received from the customer.$$$Combination of contracts$$$An entity shall combine two or more contracts  entered into at or near the$$$same time with the same customer  (or related parties of the customer) and$$$account for the contracts as a single contract if one or more of the following$$$criteria are met:$$$(a) the contracts are negotiated as a package with a single commercial$$$objective;$$$(b) the amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the$$$price or performance of the other contract; or$$$(c) the goods or services promised in the contracts (or some goods or$$$services promised in each of the contracts) are a single performance$$$obligation in accordance with paragraphs 22–30.$$$Contract modifications$$$A contract modification is a change in the scope or price (or both) of a contract$$$that is approved by the parties to the contract. In some industries and$$$jurisdictions, a contract modification may be described as a change order, a$$$variation or an amendment. A contract modification exists when the parties$$$to a contract approve a modification that either creates new or changes$$$existing enforceable rights and obligations of the parties to the contract. A$$$contract modification could be approved in writing, by oral agreement or$$$implied by customary business practices. If the parties to the contract have$$$not approved a contract modification, an entity shall continue to apply this$$$Standard to the existing contract until the contract modification is approved.$$$A contract  modification may exist even though the parties to the contract$$$have a dispute about the scope or price (or both) of the modification or the$$$parties have approved a change in the scope of the contract but have not yet$$$determined the corresponding change in price. In determining whether the$$$rights and obligations that are created or changed by a modification are$$$enforceable, an entity shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances$$$including the terms of the contract and other evidence. If the parties to a$$$contract have approved a change in the scope of the contract but have not yet$$$determined the corresponding change in price, an entity shall estimate the$$$change to the transaction price arising from the modification in accordance$$$with paragraphs 50 –54 on estimating variable consideration$$$and paragraphs 56–58 on constraining estimates of variable consideration.$$$An entity shall account for a contract  modification as a separate contract if$$$both of the following conditions are present:$$$(a) the scope of the contract increases because of the addition of promised$$$goods or services that are distinct (in accordance with$$$paragraphs 26–30); and$$$(b) the price of the contract increases by an amount of consideration that$$$reflects the entity’s stand-alone selling prices  of the additional promised$$$goods or services and any appropriate adjustments to that price to$$$reflect the circumstances of the particular contract. For example, an$$$entity may adjust the stand-alone selling price of an additional good or$$$service for a discount that the customer receives, because it is not$$$necessary for the entity to incur the selling-related costs that it would$$$incur when selling a similar good or service to a new customer.$$$If a contract  modification is not accounted for as a separate contract in$$$accordance with paragraph 20, an entity shall account for the promised goods$$$or services not yet transferred at the date of the contract modification (ie the$$$remaining promised goods or services) in whichever of the following ways is$$$applicable:$$$(a) An entity shall account for the contract modification as if it were a$$$termination of the existing contract and the creation of a new$$$contract, if the remaining goods or services are distinct from the goods$$$or services transferred on or before the date of the contract$$$modification. The amount of consideration to be allocated to the$$$remaining performance obligations (or to the remaining distinct goods$$$or services in a single performance obligation identified in accordance$$$with paragraph 22(b)) is the sum of:$$$(i) the consideration promised by the customer  (including$$$amounts already received from the customer) that was included$$$in the estimate of the transaction price and that had not been$$$recognised as revenue; and$$$(ii) the consideration promised as part of the contract$$$modification.$$$(b) An entity shall account for the contract modification as if it were a$$$part of the existing contract if the remaining goods or services are not$$$distinct and, therefore, form part of a single performance$$$obligation  that is partially satisfied at the date of the contract$$$modification. The effect that the contract modification has on$$$the transaction price, and on the entity’s measure of progress towards$$$complete satisfaction of the performance obligation, is recognised as$$$an adjustment to revenue  (either as an increase in or a reduction of$$$revenue) at the date of the contract modification (ie the adjustment to$$$revenue is made on a cumulative catch-up basis).$$$(c) If the remaining goods or services are a combination of items (a) and$$$(b), then the entity shall account for the effects of the modification on$$$the unsatisfied (including partially unsatisfied) performance$$$obligations in the modified contract in a manner that is consistent$$$with the objectives of this paragraph.$$$Identifying performance obligations$$$At contract  inception, an entity shall assess the goods or services promised$$$in a contract with a customer  and shall identify as a performance$$$obligation each promise to transfer to the customer either:$$$(a) a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct;$$$or$$$(b) a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same$$$and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer$$$(see paragraph 23).$$$A series of distinct goods or services has the same pattern of transfer to$$$the customer if both of the following criteria are met:$$$(a) each distinct good or service in the series that the entity promises to$$$transfer to the customer would meet the criteria in paragraph 35  to be$$$a performance obligation satisfied over time; and$$$(b) in accordance with paragraphs 39–40 , the same method would be used$$$to measure the entity’s progress towards complete satisfaction of the$$$performance obligation to transfer each distinct good or service in the$$$series to the customer.$$$Promises in contracts with customers$$$A contract  with a customer  generally explicitly states the goods or services$$$that an entity promises to transfer to a customer. However, the performance$$$obligations  identified in a contract with a customer may not be limited to the$$$goods or services that are explicitly stated in that contract. This is because a$$$contract with a customer may also include promises that are implied by an$$$entity’s customary business practices, published policies or specific statements$$$if, at the time of entering into the contract, those promises create a valid$$$expectation of the customer that the entity will transfer a good or service to$$$the customer.$$$Performance obligations do not include activities that an entity must$$$undertake to fulfil a contract unless those activities transfer a good or service$$$to a customer . For example, a services provider may need to perform various$$$administrative tasks to set up a contract. The performance of those tasks does$$$not transfer a service to the customer as the tasks are performed. Therefore,$$$those setup activities are not a performance obligation.$$$Distinct goods or services$$$Depending on the contract , promised goods or services may include, but are$$$not limited to, the following:$$$(a) sale of goods produced by an entity (for example, inventory of a$$$manufacturer);$$$(b) resale of goods purchased by an entity (for example, merchandise of a$$$retailer);$$$(c) resale of rights to goods or services purchased by an entity (for$$$example, a ticket resold by an entity acting as a principal, as described$$$in paragraphs B34–B38);$$$(d) performing a contractually agreed-upon task (or tasks) for a customer;$$$(e) providing a service of standing ready to provide goods or services (for$$$example, unspecified updates to software that are provided on a when-$$$and-if-available basis) or of making goods or services available for a$$$customer to use as and when the customer decides;$$$(f) providing a service of arranging for another party to transfer goods or$$$services to a customer (for example, acting as an agent of another$$$party, as described in paragraphs B34–B38);$$$(g) granting rights to goods or services to be provided in the future that a$$$customer can resell or provide to its customer (for example, an entity$$$selling a product to a retailer promises to transfer an additional good$$$or service to an individual who purchases the product from the$$$retailer);$$$(h) constructing, manufacturing or developing an asset on behalf of a$$$customer;$$$(i) granting licences (see paragraphs B52–B63B); and$$$(j) granting options to purchase additional goods or services (when those$$$options provide a customer with a material right, as described in$$$paragraphs B39–B43).$$$A good or service that is promised to a customer  is distinct if both of the$$$following criteria are met:$$$(a) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or$$$together with other resources that are readily available to the$$$customer (ie the good or service is capable of being distinct); and$$$(b) the entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is$$$separately identifiable from other promises in the contract  (ie the$$$promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of$$$the contract).$$$A customer  can benefit from a good or service in accordance with$$$paragraph 27(a) if the good or service could be used, consumed, sold for an$$$amount that is greater than scrap value or otherwise held in a way that$$$generates economic benefits. For some goods or services, a customer may be$$$able to benefit from a good or service on its own. For other goods or services, a$$$customer may be able to benefit from the good or service only in conjunction$$$with other readily available resources. A readily available resource is a good or$$$service that is sold separately (by the entity or another entity) or a resource$$$that the customer has already obtained from the entity (including goods or$$$services that the entity will have already transferred to the customer under$$$the contract ) or from other transactions or events. Various factors may$$$provide evidence that the customer can benefit from a good or service either$$$on its own or in conjunction with other readily available resources. For$$$example, the fact that the entity regularly sells a good or service separately$$$would indicate that a customer can benefit from the good or service on its$$$own or with other readily available resources.$$$In assessing whether an entity’s promises to transfer goods or services to the$$$customer  are separately identifiable in accordance with paragraph 27(b), the$$$objective is to determine whether the nature of the promise, within the$$$context of the contract , is to transfer each of those goods or services$$$individually or, instead, to transfer a combined item or items to which the$$$promised goods or services are inputs. Factors that indicate that two or more$$$promises to transfer goods or services to a customer are not separately$$$identifiable include, but are not limited to, the following:$$$(a) the entity provides a significant service of integrating the goods or$$$services with other goods or services promised in the contract into a$$$bundle of goods or services that represent the combined output or$$$outputs for which the customer has contracted. In other words, the$$$entity is using the goods or services as inputs to produce or deliver the$$$combined output or outputs specified by the customer. A combined$$$output or outputs might include more than one phase, element or$$$unit.$$$(b) one or more of the goods or services significantly modifies or$$$customises, or are significantly modified or customised by, one or$$$more of the other goods or services promised in the contract.$$$(c) the goods or services are highly interdependent or highly interrelated.$$$In other words, each of the goods or services is significantly affected by$$$one or more of the other goods or services in the contract. For$$$example, in some cases, two or more goods or services are significantly$$$affected by each other because the entity would not be able to fulfil its$$$promise by transferring each of the goods or services independently.$$$If a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity shall combine that good$$$or service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of$$$goods or services that is distinct. In some cases, that would result in the entity$$$accounting for all the goods or services promised in a contract  as a$$$single performance obligation.$$$Satisfaction of performance obligations$$$An entity shall recognise revenue  when (or as) the entity satisfies  a$$$performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service (ie an$$$asset) to a customer . An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer$$$obtains control of that asset.$$$For each performance obligation identified in accordance with$$$paragraphs 22 –30, an entity shall determine at contract  inception whether it$$$satisfies the performance obligation over time (in accordance with$$$paragraphs 35 –37) or satisfies the performance obligation at a point in time$$$(in accordance with paragraph 38). If an entity does not satisfy a performance$$$obligation over time, the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time.$$$Goods and services are assets, even if only momentarily, when they are$$$received and used (as in the case of many services). Control of an asset refers$$$to the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining$$$benefits from, the asset. Control includes the ability to prevent other entities$$$from directing the use of, and obtaining the benefits from, an asset. The$$$benefits of an asset are the potential cash flows (inflows or savings in$$$outflows) that can be obtained directly or indirectly in many ways, such as by:$$$(a) using the asset to produce goods or provide services (including public$$$services);$$$(b) using the asset to enhance the value of other assets;$$$(c) using the asset to settle liabilities or reduce expenses;$$$(d) selling or exchanging the asset;$$$(e) pledging the asset to secure a loan; and$$$(f) holding the asset.$$$When evaluating whether a customer  obtains control of an asset, an entity$$$shall consider any agreement to repurchase the asset (see paragraphs$$$B64–B76).$$$Performance obligations satisfied  over time$$$An entity transfers control of a good or service over time and, therefore,$$$satisfies a performance obligation and recognises revenue  over time, if one of$$$the following criteria is met:$$$(a) the customer  simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits$$$provided by the entity’s performance as the entity performs (see$$$paragraphs B3–B4);$$$(b) the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset (for example,$$$work in progress) that the customer controls as the asset is created or$$$enhanced (see paragraph B5); or$$$(c) the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative$$$use to the entity (see paragraph 36) and the entity has an enforceable$$$right to payment for performance completed to date (see$$$paragraph 37).$$$An asset created by an entity’s performance does not have an alternative use$$$to an entity if the entity is either restricted contractually from readily$$$directing the asset for another use during the creation or enhancement of that$$$asset or limited practically from readily directing the asset in its completed$$$state for another use. The assessment of whether an asset has an alternative$$$use to the entity is made at contract  inception. After contract inception, an$$$entity shall not update the assessment of the alternative use of an asset unless$$$the parties to the contract approve a contract modification that substantively$$$changes the performance obligation. Paragraphs B6 –B8 provide guidance for$$$assessing whether an asset has an alternative use to an entity.$$$An entity shall consider the terms of the contract , as well as any laws that$$$apply to the contract, when evaluating whether it has an enforceable right to$$$payment for performance completed to date in accordance with$$$paragraph 35(c) . The right to payment for performance completed to date does$$$not need to be for a fixed amount. However, at all times throughout the$$$duration of the contract, the entity must be entitled to an amount that at least$$$compensates the entity for performance completed to date if the contract is$$$terminated by the customer  or another party for reasons other than the$$$entity’s failure to perform as promised. Paragraphs B9 –B13  provide guidance$$$for assessing the existence and enforceability of a right to payment and$$$whether an entity’s right to payment would entitle the entity to be paid for its$$$performance completed to date.$$$Performance obligations satisfied  at a point in time$$$If a performance obligation is not satisfied over time in accordance with$$$paragraphs 35 –37, an entity satisfies the performance obligation at a point in$$$time. To determine the point in time at which a customer obtains control of a$$$promised asset and the entity satisfies a performance obligation, the entity$$$shall consider the requirements for control in paragraphs 31 –34. In addition,$$$an entity shall consider indicators of the transfer of control, which include,$$$but are not limited to, the following:$$$(a) The entity has a present right to payment for the asset—if a customer$$$is presently obliged to pay for an asset, then that may indicate that the$$$customer has obtained the ability to direct the use of, and obtain$$$substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset in exchange.$$$(b) The customer has legal title to the asset—legal title may indicate$$$which party to a contract has the ability to direct the use of, and$$$obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, an asset or to$$$restrict the access of other entities to those benefits. Therefore, the$$$transfer of legal title of an asset may indicate that the customer has$$$obtained control of the asset. If an entity retains legal title solely as$$$protection against the customer’s failure to pay, those rights of the$$$entity would not preclude the customer from obtaining control of an$$$asset.$$$(c) The entity has transferred physical possession of the asset—the$$$customer’s physical possession of an asset may indicate that the$$$customer has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially$$$all of the remaining benefits from, the asset or to restrict the access of$$$other entities to those benefits. However, physical possession may not$$$coincide with control of an asset. For example, in some repurchase$$$agreements and in some consignment arrangements, a customer or$$$consignee may have physical possession of an asset that the entity$$$controls. Conversely, in some bill-and-hold arrangements, the entity$$$may have physical possession of an asset that the customer controls.$$$Paragraphs B64 –B76 , B77–B78  and B79–B82  provide guidance on$$$accounting for repurchase agreements, consignment arrangements$$$and bill-and-hold arrangements, respectively.$$$(d) The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the$$$asset—the transfer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership of$$$an asset to the customer may indicate that the customer has obtained$$$the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the$$$remaining benefits from, the asset. However, when evaluating the$$$risks and rewards of ownership of a promised asset, an entity shall$$$exclude any risks that give rise to a separate performance obligation in$$$addition to the performance obligation to transfer the asset. For$$$example, an entity may have transferred control of an asset to a$$$customer but not yet satisfied an additional performance obligation to$$$provide maintenance services related to the transferred asset.$$$(e) The customer has accepted the asset—the customer’s acceptance of an$$$asset may indicate that it has obtained the ability to direct the use of,$$$and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the asset.$$$To evaluate the effect of a contractual customer acceptance clause on$$$when control of an asset is transferred, an entity shall consider the$$$guidance in paragraphs B83–B86.IFRS 15$$$$$$$$$Measuring progress towards complete satisfaction of a$$$performance obligation$$$For each performance obligation satisfied over time in accordance with$$$paragraphs 35 –37, an entity shall recognise revenue  over time by measuring$$$the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation.$$$The objective when measuring progress is to depict an entity’s performance in$$$transferring control of goods or services promised to a customer (ie the$$$satisfaction of an entity’s performance obligation).$$$An entity shall apply a single method of measuring progress for each$$$performance obligation satisfied over time and the entity shall apply that$$$method consistently to similar performance obligations and in similar$$$circumstances. At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall remeasure$$$its progress towards complete satisfaction of a performance obligation$$$satisfied over time.$$$Methods for measuring progress$$$Appropriate methods of measuring progress include output methods and$$$input methods. Paragraphs B14 –B19  provide guidance for using output$$$methods and input methods to measure an entity’s progress towards complete$$$satisfaction of a performance obligation. In determining the appropriate$$$method for measuring progress, an entity shall consider the nature of the$$$good or service that the entity promised to transfer to the customer.$$$When applying a method for measuring progress, an entity shall exclude from$$$the measure of progress any goods or services for which the entity does not$$$transfer control to a customer . Conversely, an entity shall include in the$$$measure of progress any goods or services for which the entity does transfer$$$control to a customer when satisfying that performance obligation.$$$As circumstances change over time, an entity shall update its measure of$$$progress to reflect any changes in the outcome of the performance obligation .$$$Such changes to an entity’s measure of progress shall be accounted for as a$$$change in accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8  Accounting Policies,$$$Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors .$$$Reasonable measures of progress$$$An entity shall recognise revenue  for a performance obligation satisfied over$$$time only if the entity can reasonably measure its progress towards complete$$$satisfaction of the performance obligation. An entity would not be able to$$$reasonably measure its progress towards complete satisfaction of a$$$performance obligation if it lacks reliable information that would be required$$$to apply an appropriate method of measuring progress.$$$In some circumstances (for example, in the early stages of a contract ), an$$$entity may not be able to reasonably measure the outcome of a performance$$$obligation , but the entity expects to recover the costs incurred in satisfying$$$the performance obligation. In those circumstances, the entity shall recognise$$$revenue  only to the extent of the costs incurred until such time that it can$$$reasonably measure the outcome of the performance obligation.$$$Measurement$$$When (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied,  an entity shall recognise$$$as revenue  the amount of the transaction price (which excludes estimates$$$of variable consideration that are constrained in accordance with$$$paragraphs 56–58) that is allocated to that performance obligation.$$$Determining the transaction price$$$An entity shall consider the terms of the contract  and its customary$$$business practices to determine the transaction price. The transaction$$$price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be$$$entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to$$$a customer , excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for$$$example, some sales taxes). The consideration promised in a contract with a$$$customer may include fixed  amounts, variable amounts, or both.$$$The nature, timing and amount of consideration promised by a customer$$$affect the estimate of the transaction price. When determining the$$$transaction price, an entity shall consider the effects of all of the following:$$$(a) variable consideration (see paragraphs 50–55 and 59);$$$(b) constraining estimates of variable consideration (see paragraphs$$$56–58);$$$(c) the existence of a significant financing component in the contract  (see$$$paragraphs 60–65);$$$(d) non-cash consideration (see paragraphs 66–69); and$$$(e) consideration payable to a customer (see paragraphs 70–72).$$$For the purpose of determining the transaction price, an entity shall assume$$$that the goods or services will be transferred to the customer as promised in$$$accordance with the existing contract and that the contract  will not be$$$cancelled, renewed or modified.$$$Variable consideration$$$If the consideration promised in a contract  includes a variable amount, an$$$entity shall estimate the amount of consideration to which the entity will be$$$entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a$$$customer.$$$An amount of consideration can vary because of discounts, rebates, refunds,$$$credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties or other$$$similar items. The promised consideration can also vary if an entity’s$$$entitlement to the consideration is contingent on the occurrence or non-$$$occurrence of a future event. For example, an amount of consideration would$$$be variable if either a product was sold with a right of return or a fixed$$$amount is promised as a performance bonus on achievement of a specified$$$milestone.$$$The variability relating to the consideration promised by a customer  may be$$$explicitly stated in the contract . In addition to the terms of the contract, the$$$promised consideration is variable if either of the following circumstances$$$exists:$$$(a) the customer has a valid expectation arising from an entity’s$$$customary business practices, published policies or specific statements$$$that the entity will accept an amount of consideration that is less than$$$the price stated in the contract. That is, it is expected that the entity$$$will offer a price concession. Depending on the jurisdiction, industry or$$$customer this offer may be referred to as a discount, rebate, refund or$$$credit.$$$(b) other facts and circumstances indicate that the entity’s intention,$$$when entering into the contract with the customer, is to offer a price$$$concession to the customer.$$$An entity shall estimate an amount of variable consideration by using either$$$of the following methods, depending on which method the entity expects to$$$better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled:$$$(a) The expected value—the expected value is the sum of probability-$$$weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. An$$$expected value may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of$$$variable consideration if an entity has a large number of contracts with$$$similar characteristics.$$$(b) The most likely amount—the most likely amount is the single most$$$likely amount in a range of possible consideration amounts (ie the$$$single most likely outcome of the contract). The most likely amount$$$may be an appropriate estimate of the amount of variable$$$consideration if the contract has only two possible outcomes (for$$$example, an entity either achieves a performance bonus or does not).$$$An entity shall apply one method consistently throughout the contract  when$$$estimating the effect of an uncertainty on an amount of variable consideration$$$to which the entity will be entitled. In addition, an entity shall consider all the$$$information (historical, current and forecast) that is reasonably available to$$$the entity and shall identify a reasonable number of possible consideration$$$amounts. The information that an entity uses to estimate the amount of$$$variable consideration would typically be similar to the information that the$$$entity’s management uses during the bid-and-proposal process and in$$$establishing prices for promised goods or services.$$$Refund liabilities$$$An entity shall recognise a refund liability if the entity receives consideration$$$from a customer and expects to refund some or all of that consideration to the$$$customer. A refund liability is measured at the amount of consideration$$$received (or receivable) for which the entity does not expect to be entitled$$$(ie amounts not included in the transaction price). The refund liability (and$$$corresponding change in the transaction price and, therefore, the contract$$$liability ) shall be updated at the end of each reporting period for changes in$$$circumstances. To account for a refund liability relating to a sale with a right$$$of return, an entity shall apply the guidance in paragraphs B20–B27.$$$Constraining estimates of variable consideration$$$An entity shall include in the transaction price some or all of an amount of$$$variable consideration estimated in accordance with paragraph 53 only to the$$$extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of$$$cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated$$$with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.$$$In assessing whether it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the$$$amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur once the uncertainty$$$related to the variable consideration is subsequently resolved, an entity shall$$$consider both the likelihood and the magnitude of the revenue reversal.$$$Factors that could increase the likelihood or the magnitude of a revenue$$$reversal include, but are not limited to, any of the following:$$$(a) the amount of consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside the$$$entity’s influence. Those factors may include volatility in a market, the$$$judgement or actions of third parties, weather conditions and a high$$$risk of obsolescence of the promised good or service.$$$(b) the uncertainty about the amount of consideration is not expected to$$$be resolved for a long period of time.$$$(c) the entity’s experience (or other evidence) with similar types of$$$contracts is limited, or that experience (or other evidence) has limited$$$predictive value.$$$(d) the entity has a practice of either offering a broad range of price$$$concessions or changing the payment terms and conditions of similar$$$contracts in similar circumstances.$$$(e) the contract has a large number and broad range of possible$$$consideration amounts.$$$An entity shall apply paragraph B63 to account for consideration in the form$$$of a sales-based or usage-based royalty that is promised in exchange for a$$$licence of intellectual property.$$$Reassessment of variable consideration$$$At the end of each reporting period, an entity shall update the estimated$$$transaction price (including updating its assessment of whether an estimate of$$$variable consideration is constrained) to represent faithfully the$$$circumstances present at the end of the reporting period and the changes in$$$circumstances during the reporting period. The entity shall account for$$$changes in the transaction price in accordance with paragraphs 87–90.$$$The existence of a significant  financing  component in the contract$$$In determining the transaction price , an entity shall adjust the promised$$$amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the$$$timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract  (either explicitly$$$or implicitly) provides the customer  or the entity with a significant benefit of$$$financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer. In those$$$circumstances, the contract contains a significant financing component. A$$$significant financing component may exist regardless of whether the promise$$$of financing is explicitly stated in the contract or implied by the payment$$$terms agreed to by the parties to the contract.$$$The objective when adjusting the promised amount of consideration for a$$$significant financing component is for an entity to recognise revenue  at an$$$amount that reflects the price that a customer  would have paid for the$$$promised goods or services if the customer had paid cash for those goods or$$$services when (or as) they transfer to the customer (ie the cash selling price).$$$An entity shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing$$$whether a contract contains a financing component and whether that$$$financing component is significant to the contract, including both of the$$$following:$$$(a) the difference, if any, between the amount of promised consideration$$$and the cash selling price of the promised goods or services; and$$$(b) the combined effect of both of the following:$$$(i) the expected length of time between when the entity transfers$$$the promised goods or services to the customer and when the$$$customer pays for those goods or services; and$$$(ii) the prevailing interest rates in the relevant market.$$$Notwithstanding the assessment in paragraph 61, a contract  with a customer$$$would not have a significant financing component if any of the following$$$factors exist:$$$(a) the customer paid for the goods or services in advance and the timing$$$of the transfer of those goods or services is at the discretion of the$$$customer.$$$(b) a substantial amount of the consideration promised by the customer is$$$variable and the amount or timing of that consideration varies on the$$$basis of the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event that is not$$$substantially within the control of the customer or the entity (for$$$example, if the consideration is a sales-based royalty).$$$(c) the difference between the promised consideration and the cash selling$$$price of the good or service (as described in paragraph 61) arises for$$$reasons other than the provision of finance to either the customer or$$$the entity, and the difference between those amounts is proportional$$$to the reason for the difference. For example, the payment terms$$$might provide the entity or the customer with protection from the$$$other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations$$$under the contract.$$$As a practical expedient, an entity need not adjust the promised amount of$$$consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the entity$$$expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the entity$$$transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer$$$pays for that good or service will be one year or less.$$$To meet the objective in paragraph 61 when adjusting the promised amount$$$of consideration for a significant financing component, an entity shall use the$$$discount rate that would be reflected in a separate financing transaction$$$between the entity and its customer  at contract inception. That rate would$$$reflect the credit characteristics of the party receiving financing in the$$$contract, as well as any collateral or security provided by the customer or the$$$entity, including assets transferred in the contract. An entity may be able to$$$determine that rate by identifying the rate that discounts the nominal$$$amount of the promised consideration to the price that the customer would$$$pay in cash for the goods or services when (or as) they transfer to the$$$customer. After contract inception, an entity shall not update the discount$$$rate for changes in interest rates or other circumstances (such as a change in$$$the assessment of the customer’s credit risk).$$$An entity shall present the effects of financing (interest revenue or interest$$$expense) separately from revenue  from contracts with customers in the$$$statement of comprehensive income. Interest revenue or interest expense is$$$recognised only to the extent that a contract asset  (or receivable) or a contract$$$liability is recognised in accounting for a contract with a customer.$$$Non-cash consideration$$$To determine the transaction price for contracts  in which a customer$$$promises consideration in a form other than cash, an entity shall measure the$$$non-cash consideration (or promise of non-cash consideration) at fair value.$$$If an entity cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the non-cash$$$consideration, the entity shall measure the consideration indirectly by$$$reference to the stand-alone selling price of the goods or services promised to$$$the customer (or class of customer) in exchange for the consideration.$$$The fair value of the non-cash consideration may vary because of the form of$$$the consideration (for example, a change in the price of a share to which an$$$entity is entitled to receive from a customer). If the fair value of the non-cash$$$consideration promised by a customer varies for reasons other than only the$$$form of the consideration (for example, the fair value could vary because of$$$the entity’s performance), an entity shall apply the requirements in$$$paragraphs 56–58.$$$If a customer contributes goods or services (for example, materials, equipment$$$or labour) to facilitate an entity’s fulfilment of the contract , the entity shall$$$assess whether it obtains control of those contributed goods or services. If so,$$$the entity shall account for the contributed goods or services as non-cash$$$consideration received from the customer.$$$Consideration payable to a customer$$$Consideration payable to a customer  includes cash amounts that an entity$$$pays, or expects to pay, to the customer (or to other parties that purchase the$$$entity’s goods or services from the customer). Consideration payable to a$$$customer also includes credit or other items (for example, a coupon or$$$voucher) that can be applied against amounts owed to the entity (or to other$$$parties that purchase the entity’s goods or services from the customer). An$$$entity shall account for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of$$$the transaction price and, therefore, of revenue unless the payment to the$$$customer is in exchange for a distinct good or service (as described in$$$paragraphs 26 –30) that the customer transfers to the entity. If the$$$consideration payable to a customer includes a variable amount, an entity$$$shall estimate the transaction price (including assessing whether the estimate$$$of variable consideration is constrained) in accordance with paragraphs 50–58.$$$If consideration payable to a customer  is a payment for a distinct good or$$$service from the customer, then an entity shall account for the purchase of$$$the good or service in the same way that it accounts for other purchases from$$$suppliers. If the amount of consideration payable to the customer exceeds the$$$fair value of the distinct good or service that the entity receives from the$$$customer, then the entity shall account for such an excess as a reduction of$$$the transaction price. If the entity cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of$$$the good or service received from the customer, it shall account for all of the$$$consideration payable to the customer as a reduction of the transaction price.$$$Accordingly, if consideration payable to a customer  is accounted for as a$$$reduction of the transaction price, an entity shall recognise the reduction of$$$revenue when (or as) the later of either of the following events occurs:$$$(a) the entity recognises revenue for the transfer of the related goods or$$$services to the customer; and$$$(b) the entity pays or promises to pay the consideration (even if the$$$payment is conditional on a future event). That promise might be$$$implied by the entity’s customary business practices.$$$Allocating the transaction price to performance$$$obligations$$$The objective when allocating the transaction price is for an entity to$$$allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation (or distinct$$$good or service) in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to$$$which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the$$$promised goods or services to the customer.$$$To meet the allocation objective, an entity shall allocate the transaction price$$$to each performance obligation identified in the contract on a relative stand-$$$alone selling price basis in accordance with paragraphs 76 –80, except as$$$specified in paragraphs 81 –83 (for allocating discounts) and paragraphs 84 –86$$$(for allocating consideration that includes variable amounts).$$$Paragraphs 76 –86 do not apply if a contract has only one performance$$$obligation . However, paragraphs 84 –86 may apply if an entity promises to$$$transfer a series of distinct goods or services identified as a single performance$$$obligation in accordance with paragraph 22(b)  and the promised consideration$$$includes variable amounts.$$$Allocation based on stand-alone selling prices$$$To allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative$$$stand-alone selling price basis, an entity shall determine the stand-alone$$$selling price at contract  inception of the distinct good or service underlying$$$each performance obligation in the contract and allocate the transaction price$$$in proportion to those stand-alone selling prices.$$$The stand-alone selling price is the price at which an entity would sell a$$$promised good or service separately to a customer . The best evidence of a$$$stand-alone selling price is the observable price of a good or service when the$$$entity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to$$$similar customers. A contractually stated price or a list price for a good or$$$service may be (but shall not be presumed to be) the stand-alone selling price$$$of that good or service.$$$If a stand-alone selling price  is not directly observable, an entity shall estimate$$$the stand-alone selling price at an amount that would result in the allocation$$$of the transaction price meeting the allocation objective in paragraph 73 .$$$When estimating a stand-alone selling price, an entity shall consider all$$$information (including market conditions, entity-specific factors and$$$information about the customer or class of customer) that is reasonably$$$available to the entity. In doing so, an entity shall maximise the use of$$$observable inputs and apply estimation methods consistently in similar$$$circumstances.$$$Suitable methods for estimating the stand-alone selling price of a good or$$$service include, but are not limited to, the following:$$$(a) Adjusted market assessment approach—an entity could evaluate the$$$market in which it sells goods or services and estimate the price that a$$$customer in that market would be willing to pay for those goods or$$$services. That approach might also include referring to prices from the$$$entity’s competitors for similar goods or services and adjusting those$$$prices as necessary to reflect the entity’s costs and margins.$$$(b) Expected cost plus a margin approach—an entity could forecast its$$$expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an$$$appropriate margin for that good or service.$$$(c) Residual approach—an entity may estimate the stand-alone selling$$$price by reference to the total transaction price less the sum of the$$$observable stand-alone selling prices of other goods or services$$$promised in the contract. However, an entity may use a residual$$$approach to estimate, in accordance with paragraph 78, the stand-$$$alone selling price of a good or service only if one of the following$$$criteria is met:$$$(i) the entity sells the same good or service to different customers$$$(at or near the same time) for a broad range of amounts (ie the$$$selling price is highly variable because a representative stand-$$$alone selling price is not discernible from past transactions or$$$other observable evidence); or$$$(ii) the entity has not yet established a price for that good or$$$service and the good or service has not previously been sold on$$$a stand-alone basis (ie the selling price is uncertain).$$$A combination of methods may need to be used to estimate the stand-alone$$$selling prices of the goods or services promised in the contract  if two or more$$$of those goods or services have highly variable or uncertain stand-alone selling$$$prices. For example, an entity may use a residual approach to estimate the$$$aggregate stand-alone selling price for those promised goods or services with$$$highly variable or uncertain stand-alone selling prices and then use another$$$method to estimate the stand-alone selling prices of the individual goods or$$$services relative to that estimated aggregate stand-alone selling price$$$determined by the residual approach. When an entity uses a combination of$$$methods to estimate the stand-alone selling price of each promised good or$$$service in the contract, the entity shall evaluate whether allocating the$$$transaction price at those estimated stand-alone selling prices would be$$$consistent with the allocation objective in paragraph 73 and the requirements$$$for estimating stand-alone selling prices in paragraph 78.$$$Allocation of a discount$$$A customer  receives a discount for purchasing a bundle of goods or services if$$$the sum of the stand-alone selling prices of those promised goods or services$$$in the contract exceeds the promised consideration in a contract . Except when$$$an entity has observable evidence in accordance with paragraph 82  that the$$$entire discount relates to only one or more, but not all, performance$$$obligations in a contract, the entity shall allocate a discount proportionately to$$$all performance obligations in the contract. The proportionate allocation of$$$the discount in those circumstances is a consequence of the entity allocating$$$the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the$$$relative stand-alone selling prices of the underlying distinct goods or services.$$$An entity shall allocate a discount entirely to one or more, but not all,$$$performance obligations in the contract if all of the following criteria are met:$$$(a) the entity regularly sells each distinct good or service (or each bundle$$$of distinct goods or services) in the contract on a stand-alone basis;$$$(b) the entity also regularly sells on a stand-alone basis a bundle (or$$$bundles) of some of those distinct goods or services at a discount to the$$$stand-alone selling prices of the goods or services in each bundle; and$$$(c) the discount attributable to each bundle of goods or services described$$$in paragraph 82(b) is substantially the same as the discount in the$$$contract and an analysis of the goods or services in each bundle$$$provides observable evidence of the performance obligation (or$$$performance obligations) to which the entire discount in the contract$$$belongs.$$$If a discount is allocated entirely to one or more performance obligations in$$$the contract  in accordance with paragraph 82, an entity shall allocate the$$$discount before using the residual approach to estimate the stand-alone$$$selling price of a good or service in accordance with paragraph 79(c).$$$Allocation of variable consideration$$$Variable consideration that is promised in a contract may be attributable to$$$the entire contract  or to a specific part of the contract, such as either of the$$$following:$$$(a) one or more, but not all, performance obligations in the contract (for$$$example, a bonus may be contingent on an entity transferring a$$$promised good or service within a specified period of time); or$$$(b) one or more, but not all, distinct goods or services promised in a series$$$of distinct goods or services that forms part of a single performance$$$obligation in accordance with paragraph 22(b) (for example, the$$$consideration promised for the second year of a two-year cleaning$$$service contract will increase on the basis of movements in a specified$$$inflation index).$$$An entity shall allocate a variable amount (and subsequent changes to that$$$amount) entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct good or service$$$that forms part of a single performance obligation in accordance with$$$paragraph 22(b) if both of the following criteria are met:$$$(a) the terms of a variable payment relate specifically to the entity’s$$$efforts to satisfy the performance obligation or transfer the distinct$$$good or service (or to a specific outcome from satisfying the$$$performance obligation or transferring the distinct good or service);$$$and$$$(b) allocating the variable amount of consideration entirely to the$$$performance obligation or the distinct good or service is consistent$$$with the allocation objective in paragraph 73 when considering all of$$$the performance obligations and payment terms in the contract.$$$The allocation requirements in paragraphs 73 –83 shall be applied to allocate$$$the remaining amount of the transaction price that does not meet the criteria$$$in paragraph 85.$$$Changes in the transaction price$$$After contract inception, the transaction price can change for various reasons,$$$including the resolution of uncertain events or other changes in$$$circumstances that change the amount of consideration to which an entity$$$expects to be entitled in exchange for the promised goods or services.$$$An entity shall allocate to the performance obligations in the contract any$$$subsequent changes in the transaction price on the same basis as at contract$$$inception. Consequently, an entity shall not reallocate the transaction price to$$$reflect changes in stand-alone selling prices  after contract inception. Amounts$$$allocated to a satisfied performance obligation shall be recognised as revenue,$$$or as a reduction of revenue, in the period in which the transaction price$$$changes.$$$An entity shall allocate a change in the transaction price entirely to one or$$$more, but not all, performance obligations or distinct goods or services$$$promised in a series that forms part of a single performance obligation in$$$accordance with paragraph 22(b) only if the criteria in paragraph 85  on$$$allocating variable consideration are met.$$$An entity shall account for a change in the transaction price that arises as a$$$result of a contract  modification in accordance with paragraphs 18 –21.$$$However, for a change in the transaction price that occurs after a contract$$$modification, an entity shall apply paragraphs 87 –89 to allocate the change in$$$the transaction price in whichever of the following ways is applicable:$$$(a) An entity shall allocate the change in the transaction price to the$$$performance obligations identified in the contract before the$$$modification if, and to the extent that, the change in the transaction$$$price is attributable to an amount of variable consideration promised$$$before the modification and the modification is accounted for in$$$accordance with paragraph 21(a).$$$(b) In all other cases in which the modification was not accounted for as a$$$separate contract in accordance with paragraph 20, an entity shall$$$allocate the change in the transaction price to the performance$$$obligations in the modified contract (ie the performance obligations$$$that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied immediately after the$$$modification).$$$Contract costs$$$Incremental costs of obtaining a contract$$$An entity shall recognise as an asset the incremental costs of obtaining a$$$contract with a customer if the entity expects to recover those costs.$$$The incremental costs of obtaining a contract  are those costs that an entity$$$incurs to obtain a contract with a customer  that it would not have incurred if$$$the contract had not been obtained (for example, a sales commission).$$$Costs to obtain a contract  that would have been incurred regardless of$$$whether the contract was obtained shall be recognised as an expense when$$$incurred, unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer$$$regardless of whether the contract is obtained.$$$As a practical expedient, an entity may recognise the incremental costs of$$$obtaining a contract  as an expense when incurred if the amortisation period$$$of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognised is one year or$$$less.$$$Costs to fulfil  a contract$$$If the costs incurred in fulfilling  a contract  with a customer  are not within$$$the scope of another Standard (for example, IAS 2 Inventories , IAS 16$$$Property, Plant and Equipment  or IAS 38 Intangible Assets ), an entity shall$$$recognise an asset from the costs incurred to fulfil  a contract only if those$$$costs meet all of the following criteria:$$$(a) the costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract$$$that the entity can specifically  identify (for example, costs relating$$$to services to be provided under renewal of an existing contract or$$$costs of designing an asset to be transferred under a specific$$$contract that has not yet been approved);$$$(b) the costs generate or enhance resources of the entity that will be$$$used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance$$$obligations in the future; and$$$(c) the costs are expected to be recovered.$$$For costs incurred in fulfilling a contract  with a customer  that are within the$$$scope of another Standard, an entity shall account for those costs in$$$accordance with those other Standards.$$$Costs that relate directly to a contract (or a specific anticipated contract)$$$include any of the following:$$$(a) direct labour (for example, salaries and wages of employees who$$$provide the promised services directly to the customer);$$$(b) direct materials (for example, supplies used in providing the promised$$$services to a customer);$$$(c) allocations of costs that relate directly to the contract or to contract$$$activities (for example, costs of contract management and supervision,$$$insurance and depreciation of tools, equipment and right ‑of ‑use assets$$$used in fulfilling the contract);$$$(d) costs that are explicitly chargeable to the customer under the contract;$$$and$$$(e) other costs that are incurred only because an entity entered into the$$$contract (for example, payments to subcontractors).$$$An entity shall recognise the following costs as expenses when incurred:$$$(a) general and administrative costs (unless those costs are explicitly$$$chargeable to the customer under the contract, in which case an entity$$$shall evaluate those costs in accordance with paragraph 97);$$$(b) costs of wasted materials, labour or other resources to fulfil the$$$contract that were not reflected in the price of the contract;$$$(c) costs that relate to satisfied performance obligations (or partially$$$satisfied performance obligations) in the contract (ie costs that relate$$$to past performance); and$$$(d) costs for which an entity cannot distinguish whether the costs relate to$$$unsatisfied performance obligations or to satisfied performance$$$obligations (or partially satisfied performance obligations).$$$Amortisation and impairment$$$An asset recognised in accordance with paragraph 91 or 95 shall be amortised$$$on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer  of$$$the goods or services to which the asset relates. The asset may relate to goods$$$or services to be transferred under a specific anticipated contract (as described$$$in paragraph 95(a)).$$$An entity shall update the amortisation to reflect a significant change in the$$$entity’s expected timing of transfer to the customer  of the goods or services to$$$which the asset relates. Such a change shall be accounted for as a change in$$$accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8.$$$An entity shall recognise an impairment loss in profit or loss to the extent$$$that the carrying amount of an asset recognised in accordance with$$$paragraph 91 or 95 exceeds:$$$(a) the remaining amount of consideration that the entity expects to$$$receive in exchange for the goods or services to which the asset relates;$$$less$$$(b) the costs that relate directly to providing those goods or services and$$$that have not been recognised as expenses (see paragraph 97).$$$For the purposes of applying paragraph 101 to determine the amount of$$$consideration that an entity expects to receive, an entity shall use the$$$principles for determining the transaction price (except for the requirements$$$in paragraphs 56 –58 on constraining estimates of variable consideration) and$$$adjust that amount to reflect the effects of the customer’s credit risk.$$$Before an entity recognises an impairment loss for an asset recognised in$$$accordance with paragraph 91 or 95, the entity shall recognise any$$$impairment loss for assets related to the contract  that are recognised in$$$accordance with another Standard (for example, IAS 2, IAS 16 and IAS 38 ).$$$After applying the impairment test in paragraph 101, an entity shall include$$$the resulting carrying amount of the asset recognised in accordance with$$$paragraph 91 or 95 in the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to$$$which it belongs for the purpose of applying IAS 36  Impairment of Assets  to that$$$cash-generating unit.$$$An entity shall recognise in profit or loss a reversal of some or all of an$$$impairment loss previously recognised in accordance with paragraph 101$$$when the impairment conditions no longer exist or have improved. The$$$increased carrying amount of the asset shall not exceed the amount that$$$would have been determined (net of amortisation) if no impairment loss had$$$been recognised previously.$$$Presentation$$$When either party to a contract  has performed, an entity shall present the$$$contract in the statement of financial  position as a contract asset  or a$$$contract liability, depending on the relationship between the entity’s$$$performance and the customer’s payment. An entity shall present any$$$unconditional rights to consideration separately as a receivable.$$$If a customer  pays consideration, or an entity has a right to an amount of$$$consideration that is unconditional (ie a receivable), before the entity transfers$$$a good or service to the customer, the entity shall present the contract  as$$$a contract liability when the payment is made or the payment is due$$$(whichever is earlier). A contract liability is an entity’s obligation to transfer$$$goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received$$$consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer.$$$If an entity performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before$$$the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, the entity shall$$$present the contract as a contract asset , excluding any amounts presented as a$$$receivable. A contract asset is an entity’s right to consideration in exchange$$$for goods or services that the entity has transferred to a customer . An entity$$$shall assess a contract asset for impairment in accordance with IFRS 9 . An$$$impairment of a contract asset shall be measured, presented and disclosed on$$$the same basis as a financial asset that is within the scope of IFRS 9 (see also$$$paragraph 113(b)).$$$A receivable is an entity’s right to consideration that is unconditional. A right$$$to consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is required before$$$payment of that consideration is due. For example, an entity would recognise$$$a receivable if it has a present right to payment even though that amount may$$$be subject to refund in the future. An entity shall account for a receivable in$$$accordance with IFRS 9. Upon initial recognition of a receivable from$$$a contract  with a customer , any difference between the measurement of the$$$receivable in accordance with IFRS 9 and the corresponding amount$$$of revenue  recognised shall be presented as an expense (for example, as an$$$impairment loss).$$$This Standard uses the terms ‘contract asset’ and ‘contract liability’ but does$$$not prohibit an entity from using alternative descriptions in the statement of$$$financial position for those items. If an entity uses an alternative description$$$for a contract asset, the entity shall provide sufficient information for a user$$$of the financial statements to distinguish between receivables and contract$$$assets.$$$Disclosure$$$The objective of the disclosure requirements is for an entity to disclose$$$sufficient  information to enable users of financial  statements to$$$understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue  and$$$cash flows  arising from contracts  with customers . To achieve that$$$objective, an entity shall disclose qualitative and quantitative information$$$about all of the following:$$$(a) its contracts with customers (see paragraphs 113–122);$$$(b) the significant  judgements, and changes in the judgements, made in$$$applying this Standard to those contracts (see paragraphs 123 –126);$$$and$$$(c) any assets recognised from the costs to obtain or fulfil  a contract$$$with a customer in accordance with paragraph 91 or 95 (see$$$paragraphs 127–128).$$$An entity shall consider the level of detail necessary to satisfy the disclosure$$$objective and how much emphasis to place on each of the various$$$requirements. An entity shall aggregate or disaggregate disclosures so that$$$useful information is not obscured by either the inclusion of a large amount$$$of insignificant detail or the aggregation of items that have substantially$$$different characteristics.$$$An entity need not disclose information in accordance with this Standard if it$$$has provided the information in accordance with another Standard.$$$Contracts with customers$$$An entity shall disclose all of the following amounts for the reporting period$$$unless those amounts are presented separately in the statement of$$$comprehensive income in accordance with other Standards:$$$(a) revenue  recognised from contracts  with customers , which the entity$$$shall disclose separately from its other sources of revenue; and$$$(b) any impairment losses recognised (in accordance with IFRS 9) on any$$$receivables or contract assets arising from an entity’s contracts with$$$customers, which the entity shall disclose separately from impairment$$$losses from other contracts.$$$Disaggregation of revenue$$$An entity shall disaggregate revenue  recognised from contracts  with$$$customers  into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing and$$$uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. An$$$entity shall apply the guidance in paragraphs B87 –B89  when selecting the$$$categories to use to disaggregate revenue.$$$In addition, an entity shall disclose sufficient information to enable users of$$$financial statements to understand the relationship between the disclosure of$$$disaggregated revenue  (in accordance with paragraph 114) and revenue$$$information that is disclosed for each reportable segment, if the entity applies$$$IFRS 8  Operating Segments .$$$Contract balances$$$An entity shall disclose all of the following:$$$(a) the opening and closing balances of receivables, contract$$$assets  and contract liabilities from contracts  with customers , if not$$$otherwise separately presented or disclosed;$$$(b) revenue  recognised in the reporting period that was included in the$$$contract liability balance at the beginning of the period; and$$$(c) revenue recognised in the reporting period from performance$$$obligations  satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods (for$$$example, changes in transaction price).$$$An entity shall explain how the timing of satisfaction of its performance$$$obligations  (see paragraph 119(a)) relates to the typical timing of payment (see$$$paragraph 119(b)) and the effect that those factors have on the contract asset$$$and the contract liability balances. The explanation provided may use$$$qualitative information.$$$An entity shall provide an explanation of the significant changes in$$$the contract asset and the contract liability balances during the reporting$$$period. The explanation shall include qualitative and quantitative$$$information. Examples of changes in the entity’s balances of contract assets$$$and contract liabilities include any of the following:$$$(a) changes due to business combinations;$$$(b) cumulative catch-up adjustments to revenue  that affect the$$$corresponding contract asset or contract liability, including$$$adjustments arising from a change in the measure of progress, a$$$change in an estimate of the transaction price (including any changes$$$in the assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is$$$constrained) or a contract modification;$$$(c) impairment of a contract asset;$$$(d) a change in the time frame for a right to consideration to become$$$unconditional (ie for a contract asset to be reclassified to a receivable);$$$and$$$(e) a change in the time frame for a performance obligation to be satisfied$$$(ie for the recognition of revenue arising from a contract liability).$$$Performance obligations$$$An entity shall disclose information about its performance obligations  in$$$contracts with customers, including a description of all of the following:$$$(a) when the entity typically satisfies its performance obligations (for$$$example, upon shipment, upon delivery, as services are rendered or$$$upon completion of service), including when performance obligations$$$are satisfied in a bill-and-hold arrangement;$$$(b) the significant payment terms (for example, when payment is typically$$$due, whether the contract has a significant financing component,$$$whether the consideration amount is variable and whether the$$$estimate of variable consideration is typically constrained in$$$accordance with paragraphs 56–58);$$$(c) the nature of the goods or services that the entity has promised to$$$transfer, highlighting any performance obligations to arrange for$$$another party to transfer goods or services (ie if the entity is acting as$$$an agent);$$$(d) obligations for returns, refunds and other similar obligations; and$$$(e) types of warranties and related obligations.$$$Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance$$$obligations$$$An entity shall disclose the following information about its remaining$$$performance obligations:$$$(a) the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the$$$performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied)$$$as of the end of the reporting period; and$$$(b) an explanation of when the entity expects to recognise as revenue the$$$amount disclosed in accordance with paragraph 120(a), which the$$$entity shall disclose in either of the following ways:$$$(i) on a quantitative basis using the time bands that would be$$$most appropriate for the duration of the remaining$$$performance obligations; or$$$(ii) by using qualitative information.$$$As a practical expedient, an entity need not disclose the information in$$$paragraph 120 for a performance obligation if either of the following$$$conditions is met:$$$(a) the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original$$$expected duration of one year or less; or$$$(b) the entity recognises revenue  from the satisfaction of the performance$$$obligation in accordance with paragraph B16.$$$An entity shall explain qualitatively whether it is applying the practical$$$expedient in paragraph 121 and whether any consideration from contracts$$$with customers  is not included in the transaction price and, therefore, not$$$included in the information disclosed in accordance with paragraph 120. For$$$example, an estimate of the transaction price would not include any estimated$$$amounts of variable consideration that are constrained (see paragraphs$$$56–58).$$$Significant  judgements in the application of this Standard$$$An entity shall disclose the judgements, and changes in the judgements, made$$$in applying this Standard that significantly affect the determination of the$$$amount and timing of revenue  from contracts  with customers . In particular,$$$an entity shall explain the judgements, and changes in the judgements, used$$$in determining both of the following:$$$(a) the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations (see paragraphs$$$124–125); and$$$(b) the transaction price and the amounts allocated to performance$$$obligations (see paragraph 126).$$$Determining the timing of satisfaction of performance obligations$$$For performance obligations that an entity satisfies over time, an entity shall$$$disclose both of the following:$$$(a) the methods used to recognise revenue  (for example, a description of$$$the output methods or input methods used and how those methods$$$are applied); and$$$(b) an explanation of why the methods used provide a faithful depiction of$$$the transfer of goods or services.$$$For performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, an entity shall$$$disclose the significant judgements made in evaluating when a customer$$$obtains control of promised goods or services.$$$Determining the transaction price and the amounts allocated to$$$performance obligations$$$An entity shall disclose information about the methods, inputs and$$$assumptions used for all of the following:$$$(a) determining the transaction price, which includes, but is not limited$$$to, estimating variable consideration, adjusting the consideration for$$$the effects of the time value of money and measuring non-cash$$$consideration;$$$(b) assessing whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained;$$$(c) allocating the transaction price, including estimating stand-alone$$$selling prices of promised goods or services and allocating discounts$$$and variable consideration to a specific part of the contract  (if$$$applicable); and$$$(d) measuring obligations for returns, refunds and other similar$$$obligations.$$$Assets recognised from the costs to obtain or fulfil  a$$$contract with a customer$$$An entity shall describe both of the following:$$$(a) the judgements made in determining the amount of the costs incurred$$$to obtain or fulfil a contract  with a customer  (in accordance with$$$paragraph 91 or 95); and$$$(b) the method it uses to determine the amortisation for each reporting$$$period.$$$An entity shall disclose all of the following:$$$(a) the closing balances of assets recognised from the costs incurred to$$$obtain or fulfil a contract  with a customer  (in accordance with$$$paragraph 91 or 95), by main category of asset (for example, costs to$$$obtain contracts with customers, pre ‑contract costs and setup costs);$$$and$$$(b) the amount of amortisation and any impairment losses recognised in$$$the reporting period.$$$Practical expedients$$$If an entity elects to use the practical expedient in either paragraph 63 (about$$$the existence of a significant financing component) or paragraph 94 (about the$$$incremental costs of obtaining a contract), the entity shall disclose that fact.$$$$$$Appendix A'"
